### Note About Frontend:

In this project I strongly focused on Backend and Flask. So I did not gave much time in the frontend. This frontend was created using React JS some times ago by me when I was learning React JS. ([Check](https://github.com/TheProjectsX/BlogWebsite-01))

This Frontend is actually a Wordpress Theme, I have no Idea where I found it!

### Backend:

Backend was created using Flask and MongoDB as DataBase. I was hoping to create a Resume worthy project using Flask. And this is what I have done.
